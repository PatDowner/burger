  ## Description:
  
  This is a full-stack application to keep track of burgers you'd like to try and whether or not you have already devoured one.

  The app uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM and follows MVC design pattern. Some of the styling comes from the Bootstrap library.
  

  ## Installation:
  
  Go to the [deployed app](https://aqueous-castle-96874.herokuapp.com/) to interact use it. No installation necessary.
  

  ## Usage:
  
  
  * At the site, enter the name of a burger you'd like to try in the `Burger Name` field then click `Add Burger`.
  * The burger will be added to the left hand column of `Not Devoured`.
  * Once you have tried a burger, click on the `Devour It!` button. The burger will move to the bottom of the right hand `Devoured` column.
  * If you wish to remove the burger from the `Devoured` column, click the red trashcan button.
